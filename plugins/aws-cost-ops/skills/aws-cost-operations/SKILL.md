# AWS Cost & Operations

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for AWS cost optimization, monitoring, observability, and operational excellence with integrated MCP servers.

## AWS Documentation Requirement

**CRITICAL**: This skill requires AWS MCP tools for accurate, up-to-date AWS information.

### Before Answering AWS Questions

1. **Always verify** using AWS MCP tools (if available):
   - `mcp__aws-mcp__aws___search_documentation` or `mcp__*awsdocs*__aws___search_documentation` - Search AWS docs
   - `mcp__aws-mcp__aws___read_documentation` or `mcp__*awsdocs*__aws___read_documentation` - Read specific pages
   - `mcp__aws-mcp__aws___get_regional_availability` - Check service availability

2. **If AWS MCP tools are unavailable**:
   - Guide user to configure AWS MCP: See [AWS MCP Setup Guide](../../docs/aws-mcp-setup.md)
   - Help determine which option fits their environment:
     - Has uvx + AWS credentials → Full AWS MCP Server
     - No Python/credentials → AWS Documentation MCP (no auth)
   - If cannot determine → Ask user which option to use

## Cost Optimization Best Practices

### Pre-Deployment Cost Estimation

**Always estimate costs before deploying**:
1. Use **AWS Pricing MCP** to estimate resource costs
2. Compare pricing across different regions
3. Evaluate alternative service options
4. Calculate expected monthly costs
5. Plan for scaling and growth

**Example workflow**:
```
"Estimate the monthly cost of running a Lambda function with
1 million invocations, 512MB memory, 3-second duration in us-east-1"
```

### Cost Analysis and Optimization

**Regular cost reviews**:
1. Use **Cost Explorer MCP** to analyze spending trends
2. Identify cost anomalies and unexpected charges
3. Review costs by service, region, and environment
4. Compare actual vs. budgeted costs
5. Generate cost optimization recommendations

**Cost optimization strategies**:
- Right-size over-provisioned resources
- Use appropriate storage classes (S3, EBS)
- Implement auto-scaling for dynamic workloads
- Leverage Savings Plans and Reserved Instances
- Delete unused resources and snapshots
- Use cost allocation tags effectively

### Budget Monitoring

**Track spending against budgets**:
1. Use **Billing and Cost Management MCP** to monitor budgets
2. Set up budget alerts for threshold breaches
3. Review budget utilization regularly
4. Adjust budgets based on trends
5. Implement cost controls and governance

## Monitoring and Observability Best Practices

### CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms

**Implement comprehensive monitoring**:
1. Use **CloudWatch MCP** to query metrics and logs
2. Set up alarms for critical metrics:
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - Error rates and latency
   - Queue depths and processing times
   - API gateway throttling
   - Lambda errors and timeouts
3. Create CloudWatch dashboards for visualization
4. Use log insights for troubleshooting

**Example alarm scenarios**:
- Lambda error rate > 1%
- EC2 CPU utilization > 80%
- API Gateway 4xx/5xx error spike
- DynamoDB throttled requests
- ECS task failures

### Application Performance Monitoring

**Monitor application health**:
1. Use **CloudWatch Application Signals MCP** for APM
2. Track service-level objectives (SLOs)
3. Monitor application dependencies
4. Identify performance bottlenecks
5. Set up distributed tracing

### Container and Kubernetes Monitoring

**For containerized workloads**:
1. Use **AWS Managed Prometheus MCP** for metrics
2. Monitor container resource utilization
